Well I don't plan on telling my friends about this. My name is Ed for short. 
I've started programming and I am willing create a line of footsteps (metaphorically speaking) as I reach my maximum abilitiy in my learning expeirence.
What do I say to thee lost in a page of code. 
  You are lost. 
  You have decided that something is better than nothing. 
  Listeing to the people aroumd you have become a pointless mistake.
    and you dare not be fooled again.
  Pay close attetion to my words. 
  I do not owe you jack squat
  you are here because you are here.
